HTML code is made up of elements.

html - the root element(eldest parent in the hierachy)

Each element has an opening tag and a closing tag. e.g. <title> </title>

Within the two tags, an element can have text content or other elements(children)

The opening tag usually has attributes which add functionality or add information/label
about an element

Some elements are self closing(have no closing tag)-- these elements usualy
 have atleast one attribute
